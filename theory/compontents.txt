//component in Angular
======================================================================
In Angular, a component is the fundamental building block of the UI.
Each component controls a portion of the screen called a view.

src/
└── app/
    └── user/
        ├── user.component.ts
        ├── user.component.html
        ├── user.component.css
        └── user.component.spec.ts

Creating a Component --> "ng generate component component_name" or "ng g c component_name"

| Hook            | Purpose                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ngOnInit()`    | Called once after component is initialized |
| `ngOnChanges()` | Called when input properties change        |
| `ngOnDestroy()` | Called just before component is destroyed  |

Best Practices
--> Keep components small and focused.
--> Use @Input() and @Output() for passing data.
--> Separate logic into services when needed.
--> Avoid business logic inside templates.
