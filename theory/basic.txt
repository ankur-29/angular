//interpolation in Angular
================================================================================
Interpolation in Angular is a technique used to bind component class data into the HTML template.
Itâ€™s the most basic form of data binding and is primarily used for displaying dynamic values.
{{expression}}

You cannot use assignments or flow control statements like if, for, etc.

Use interpolation for string and number rendering.
Prefer property binding ([src], [href], etc.) for attributes and DOM properties.
<img src="{{ imageUrl }}" />
